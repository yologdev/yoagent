//! LLM-based background compaction — a [`CompactionStrategy`] that summarizes
//! old history with a standalone LLM request instead of discarding it.
//!
//! The default [`DefaultCompaction`](crate::context::DefaultCompaction) is
//! deterministic: truncate → one-line summaries → drop. That is fast,
//! byte-stable and free, but lossy in the worst way — decisions and constraints
//! from early turns simply vanish. This strategy spends tokens to get them back
//! as prose: a "shift-handoff briefing" covering goals, progress, and decisions,
//! spliced in where the dropped span used to be.
//!
//! # Choosing the summarizer
//!
//! **The summarizer must be fast enough to finish before the budget is
//! crossed.** Reusing the loop's `ModelConfig` —
//! `LlmCompaction::from_config(cfg)` with the session's own config — is the
//! obvious call, and for a slow loop model it is the worst one: `compact` then
//! finds no briefing ready and takes the deterministic tiers, so the retention
//! this strategy exists for is silently not delivered.
//!
//! Reusing the config is fine when the loop model is *already* cheap and fast;
//! see the #127 section below, where DeepSeek-in-session beats
//! DeepSeek-standalone. The rule is about speed, not about sharing a config.
//!
//! Measured on the `long_horizon` harness at a 30K configured budget (26K after
//! the `system_prompt_tokens` reserve), **one run each — the model is not
//! deterministic, so read these as the shape of the effect, not as calibrated
//! figures**. Both rows are the harness's own `[compaction #1]` line, and the
//! two runs differ only in the summarizer:
//!
//! | summarizer | first compaction | history retained |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | the loop's model (Sonnet 5) | `Deterministic` | 3 msgs / 1.7K tokens |
//! | a fast model (Haiku 4.5) | `Summarized` | 22 msgs / 16.7K tokens |
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --example long_horizon        # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, YO_LOG=debug
//! ```
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! LlmCompaction::from_config(ModelConfig::claude_haiku_4_5())   // not the loop's config
//! ```
//!
//! When briefings keep losing that race the strategy says so once, via
//! `tracing::warn!`, rather than degrading silently. Note what it does *not*
//! claim: while a request is in flight `arm` starts no second one, so a very
//! slow summarizer costs fewer requests than it does fallbacks — measured at 19
//! fallbacks against 7 billed requests. The waste is worst in the middle
//! regime, where the briefing lands but always just too late.
//!
//! # What it buys, and what it costs
//!
//! **Buys: retention quality, at no added loop latency.**
//! [`CompactionStrategy::compact`] is synchronous and sits on the hot path
//! directly before each LLM turn, so a summarization round-trip cannot happen
//! there — it would add seconds of latency exactly when the session is busiest.
//! Instead the request runs in the background and the result is spliced in on a
//! later turn:
//!
//! ```text
//! turn N   (usage crosses trigger_ratio · budget)
//!   └── spawn: summarize messages[head_end..cut) with a standalone request
//! turn N+1..M: loop continues untouched, no stall, no request
//! turn M   (usage crosses the budget)
//!   └── splice: [head][summary][tail cut..]
//! ```
//!
//! **Costs: tokens the default never spends.** Each summarization request pays
//! input tokens for the whole summarized span plus output tokens for the
//! briefing, on top of the session's own traffic, and a long session summarizes
//! repeatedly. Route it at a cheap model (see below) and watch the numbers on
//! [`AgentEvent::ContextCompacted`], which reports the request's own usage next
//! to the tokens it saved.
//!
//! # Why the request is standalone, not appended to the live session
//!
//! An obvious-looking optimisation is to append the summarization instruction
//! to the *live* session instead: the history is then a prefix-cache hit, so
//! the span costs cached-input rates rather than fresh input. Measured against
//! real pricing, it is a bad trade almost everywhere, and the reason is
//! counterintuitive enough to be worth recording (yologdev/yoagent#127).
//!
//! In-session forces the briefing to be billed at the **loop model's** output
//! rate. Output runs 5-10x input, so the cache saving on the span is swamped
//! by the output penalty — and the more expensive the loop model, the worse it
//! gets. Per compaction, at a ~12K history / ~8K span / ~1K briefing:
//!
//! | loop model | standalone on Haiku | appended in-session |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Sonnet 5 | $0.0130 | $0.0126 |
//! | Opus 5 | $0.0130 | $0.0315 |
//! | Fable 5 | $0.0130 | $0.0630 |
//!
//! So the idea is backwards: it was motivated by "reuse the expensive model's
//! cache", and the expensive model is exactly where it loses. It only wins when
//! the loop model *is* the summarizer — DeepSeek in-session runs 3.2x cheaper
//! than DeepSeek standalone — which is the configuration this strategy already
//! steers away from, since routing summarization at a cheap model is the
//! documented shape.
//!
//! The downside is worse than the upside. A background request that races the
//! loop's own turn can arrive before the cache write lands and miss entirely,
//! paying full input on the *whole history* rather than fresh input on the
//! span: 2.6x the standalone cost on Sonnet. The best case is a few percent,
//! the failure case is a 2.6x overrun, and the race is not something this
//! crate controls.
//!
//! Recorded as **no-go**. Revisit if a provider appears whose output rates are
//! flat across model tiers, or if a same-model summarizer becomes the common
//! configuration rather than the fallback.
//!
//! **Does not buy: fewer prefix-cache breaks.** Both strategies rewrite history
//! only when the budget is crossed, and neither rewrites in between, so the
//! number of rewrites over a session is a wash: **6 vs 6** over 120 turns at a
//! 20k budget, **6 vs 5** over 600 turns at 100k. Splicing at the last possible
//! moment describes when this strategy breaks the cache relative to a
//! *synchronous* summarizer, which must break it the moment it decides to
//! summarize. It is not an advantage over
//! [`DefaultCompaction`](crate::context::DefaultCompaction).
//!
//! Those figures are reproducible rather than folklore. They come from
//! `tests/prefix_cache_harness.rs`, measured at commit `719160f`:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --test prefix_cache_harness -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Re-run it and update this section after any change to compaction sizing —
//! [`ContextConfig::compact_target_ratio`], [`ContextConfig::compact_headroom_turns`],
//! [`DEFAULT_TRIGGER_RATIO`] and the `retain_tail_tokens` derivation all move
//! these numbers, and nothing in CI will notice if they drift.
//!
//! # Guarantees
//!
//! **The loop can never wedge on this strategy.** Summary not ready, provider
//! down, rate-limited, no tokio runtime — compaction falls back to the
//! deterministic [`compact_messages`] for that turn and the loop keeps going.
//!
//! **A stale summary is never spliced.** The snapshotted prefix is fingerprinted
//! over its serialized bytes; on any mismatch the summary is discarded and a
//! fresh one is started.
//!
//! **A summary is never paid for and then thrown away.** The background request
//! is always fingerprinted against the history `compact` is about to *return*,
//! never the one it received. That distinction is load-bearing: the agent loop
//! writes the return value straight back into the session, so anchoring on the
//! input meant that whenever the deterministic fallback rewrote history the
//! pending summary was invalidated by the same call that ordered it — discarded
//! on arrival, replaced by another request against a prefix the next fallback
//! would rewrite in turn. That state was absorbing, and it cost one billed
//! request per compaction for a result identical to
//! [`DefaultCompaction`](crate::context::DefaultCompaction)'s.
//!
//! **The briefing survives the safety net.** When a splice still exceeds the
//! budget the tail is compacted in place rather than the whole history: the
//! summary sits exactly where `level3_drop_middle` starts cutting, so the naive
//! move destroys what was just paid for. If head plus briefing exceed the budget
//! on their own the briefing genuinely cannot be kept — the event then reports
//! [`CompactionMethod::Deterministic`], because claiming a splice the result
//! does not contain is worse than reporting the fallback.
//!
//! **A bad briefing is never spliced.** Splicing *deletes* the span it replaces,
//! so a briefing is validated before it is allowed to: a non-`Stop` stop reason
//! (a `Length`-truncated handoff missing its "Open items" section, a `Refusal`,
//! an overflow `Error`) is rejected with the reason logged, and the turn falls
//! back to the deterministic tiers.
//!
//! **Failure is never silent, and never permanent.** The request has a timeout
//! ([`DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`]) and retries retryable errors; the in-flight
//! slot is released by a drop guard, so a hung, panicking, or dropped task
//! cannot pin it for the rest of the session. Every path that gives up says so
//! at `warn!`, and the per-compaction cost is logged at `info!` whether or not
//! an event sender is wired.
//!
//! # One accepted limit
//!
//! **The API key is resolved once, at construction.**
//! [`from_config`](LlmCompaction::from_config) reads the provider-conventional
//! environment variable when the strategy is built (warning if it finds none)
//! and holds the result for its lifetime. Note this is *not*
//! [`Agent`](crate::Agent)'s contract: `Agent` resolves lazily per request, so
//! it does pick up a rotated environment key. Build a fresh strategy — or pass
//! [`with_api_key`](LlmCompaction::with_api_key) — if credentials rotate
//! mid-session.
//!
//! # Known limitation: the headroom policy does not apply
//!
//! [`ContextConfig::compact_target_ratio`] and
//! [`ContextConfig::compact_headroom_turns`] size the deterministic tiers, and
//! the agent loop adapts the ratio to the session's observed growth. The
//! *spliced* result ignores both — its size is set by
//! [`with_retain_tail_tokens`](LlmCompaction::with_retain_tail_tokens) instead.
//! The deterministic fallback and the safety net do still honour them, since
//! both run through [`compact_messages`]. Consuming the adapted target on the
//! splice path is follow-up work; until then, tune the tail directly if the
//! interval between compactions matters to you.
//!
//! # Model routing
//!
//! The summarization request is standalone — its own system prompt, no session
//! history, no tools — so it can use a different, cheaper model than the main
//! loop at no cost to the session itself:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use yoagent::provider::ModelConfig;
//! use yoagent::{Agent, LlmCompaction};
//!
//! // Provider and key resolved from the config, same as `Agent::from_config`.
//! let compaction = LlmCompaction::from_config(ModelConfig::anthropic(
//!     "claude-haiku-4-5",
//!     "Haiku 4.5",
//! ));
//!
//! let agent = Agent::from_config(ModelConfig::anthropic("claude-sonnet-5", "Sonnet 5"))
//!     .with_compaction_strategy(compaction);
//! ```
