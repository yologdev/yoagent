//! Context window management — smart truncation and token counting.
//!
//! The #1 engineering challenge for agents. This module provides:
//! - Token estimation (fast, no external deps)
//! - Tiered compaction (tool output truncation → turn summarization → full summary)
//! - Execution limits (max turns, tokens, duration)
//!
//! Designed based on Claude Code's approach: clear old tool outputs first,
//! then summarize conversation if needed.
