//! Live evaluation harness for [`LlmCompaction`] — the one thing mocks cannot
//! check: whether the briefings are any good.
//!
//! Everything about the strategy is verified against `MockProvider`: the state
//! machine, the fingerprint, the boundary arithmetic, the cost accounting. None
//! of that tells you whether `DEFAULT_INSTRUCTION` produces a handoff a real
//! agent could actually continue from. This runs a real multi-turn session at a
//! deliberately small context budget, forces the strategy to splice, records the
//! whole thing into a GASP repo, and prints every briefing verbatim next to what
//! it cost.
//!
//! Read the briefings before the default prompt ossifies into released docs.
//!
//! ```text
//! export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
//! cargo run --example llm_compaction_live --features gasp
//! ```
//!
//! Environment overrides:
//!
//! | var | default | why you'd change it |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `YO_TRIGGER` | `0.6` | fraction of budget at which summarization starts; lower buys wall-clock headroom |
//! | `YO_BUDGET` | `12000` (`4000` in dry run) | smaller splices sooner and costs less; larger is more realistic |
//! | `YO_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5` | the session's model |
//! | `YO_SUMMARIZER` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | the model that writes briefings — the thing under evaluation |
//! | `YO_MAX_TURNS` | `40` | hard cap, in case the budget is never crossed |
//! | `YO_KEEP_RECENT` | `4` | messages held verbatim; the default 10 needs a production budget |
//! | `YO_KEEP_FIRST` | `0` | opening turns held verbatim. **0 on purpose** — at the crate default of 2 the turn that states the constraints never leaves the context, so a retention probe passes without the briefing carrying anything |
//! | `YO_REPO` | `/tmp/yoagent-compaction-live` | GASP repo path |
