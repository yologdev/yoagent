//! Offline sweep of the compaction headroom policy — the measurement
//! [#150](https://github.com/yologdev/yoagent/issues/150) asks for.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo run --example headroom_sweep`
//!
//! # Why offline
//!
//! Two of the four things that matter are **pure functions of the compaction
//! code** — how often a session compacts, and how much history survives each
//! time — so they can be swept densely for free and deterministically, without
//! a provider in the loop. Only prefix-cache hit rate and briefing splice rate
//! need live runs, and those are worth spending on a shortlist rather than a
//! grid.
//!
//! This drives the real `effective_target_ratio` and `compact_messages`, not a
//! reimplementation of them.
//!
//! # The question
//!
//! `compact_headroom_turns` defaults to `Some(30)`: "leave room for 30 more
//! turns". `effective_target_ratio` computes `budget - turns * growth`, floored
//! at `MIN_HEADROOM_RATIO` (0.15 when this was written; 0.30 since 0.22). For any session growing faster than
//! `budget/30` per turn that demand exceeds the budget outright and pins the
//! ratio to the floor.
//!
//! Whether that is *wrong* is the open question. Compacting to 15% means
//! compacting rarely but destructively; compacting to 70% means often but
//! gently. Frequent compaction is the expensive one for prefix caching, since
//! each one invalidates the cached prefix past the head — so "aggressive but
//! rare" may well be the right trade, and the floor defensible.
//!
//! What this measures: for a realistic range of growth rates, how many
//! compactions a session takes and how much history it holds, under each
//! candidate policy.
//!
//! One limit: history here is pairs of *user* messages, which levels 1 and 2
//! never touch, so every compaction is a level-3 cut. `compaction_sweep`
//! repeats the measurement over transcripts with real tool calls and results,
//! where level 2 usually decides the post-compaction size instead — see
//! `docs/evals/compaction-defaults.md`.
