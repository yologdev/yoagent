# Prompt Caching

yoagent automatically optimizes API costs through prompt caching. For providers that support it, stable content (system prompts, tool definitions, conversation history) is cached between turns, giving you up to **90% savings** on input tokens.

## How It Works

In a multi-turn agent loop, each request sends the full context: system prompt + tools + conversation history. Without caching, you pay full price for all of it every turn. With caching, the provider reuses previously processed prefixes.

### Provider Support

| Provider | Caching Type | Savings | Framework Action |
|----------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Anthropic** | Explicit (cache breakpoints) | 90% on hits | ✅ Auto-placed `cache_control` |
| **OpenAI** | Automatic (>1024 tokens), key-routed | 90% on hits | ✅ Sends `prompt_cache_key` |
| **DeepSeek** | Automatic prefix cache | ~97% on hits | None needed |
| **Google Gemini** | Implicit (automatic) | Varies | None needed — see below |
| **Azure OpenAI** | Automatic (same as OpenAI) | 90% on hits | Not wired |
| **OpenAI Responses** | Automatic, key-routed | 90% on hits | Not wired |
| **Amazon Bedrock** | Explicit (`cachePoint` blocks) | — | Not wired |

Savings are the cached-read discount off base input in this crate's own price
presets (`CostConfig`) — e.g. `gpt_5_5` prices input at $5/MTok and cache reads
at $0.50. They are model-dependent; check `CostConfig` for the model you use.

"Not wired" means the provider supports something and yoagent does not send it
yet, as distinct from "None needed", where the provider caches on its own.

Providers cache in two different shapes, and `CacheStrategy` means something
different in each. **Explicit breakpoints** (Anthropic) let the client choose
cache boundaries and charge a write premium for them — that is what `Auto` and
`Manual` place. **Key-routed** (OpenAI) caches automatically once a prefix
passes ~1024 tokens; there are no boundaries to choose, and `prompt_cache_key`
only steers requests from one conversation toward the same cache. Everything
else caches server-side with nothing to configure, and `CacheStrategy` is inert
— including `Disabled`, which cannot switch off caching the client never
requested.

The practical consequence: **a hit rate is not comparable across protocols
without knowing which shape produced it.** See the measured comparison below.

### What Gets Cached (Anthropic)

yoagent places up to 3 cache breakpoints automatically:

1. **System prompt** — stable across all turns
2. **Tool definitions** — rarely change between turns
3. **Conversation history** — second-to-last message, so the growing prefix is cached

This means on a typical multi-turn conversation, only the latest user message and the new assistant response cost full price.

### OpenAI

OpenAI caches prefixes of roughly 1024 tokens or more on its own, so there is
nothing to place. What yoagent sends is `prompt_cache_key`, which routes a
request to a machine while the cache itself stays content-addressed.

The key comes from `CacheConfig::session_key` when you set one, and is
otherwise derived from the **system prompt alone**. That is the cacheable
prefix — the thing the provider actually caches — and `StreamConfig` carries it
in its own field, where compaction cannot reach it.

An earlier version mixed in the first user message too, for session
discrimination. It did not survive yoagent's own compaction: `compact_messages`
can drop the head and insert a *constant* marker at index 0 (constant on
purpose, so the cached prefix stays byte-stable). The key drifted mid-session
**and** every session sharing a system prompt collapsed onto one value —
failing precisely on long sessions, which are the ones caching exists for.
Session identity is not recoverable from a per-request snapshot.

**So sessions sharing a system prompt share a key by design.** That is the
correct grouping — they share the cached prefix — but it concentrates traffic
on one cache. Set `session_key` explicitly to spread load, which is also what
OpenAI recommends for a hot key:

```rust,ignore
let agent = Agent::from_config(ModelConfig::openai("gpt-5.5", "GPT-5.5"))
    .with_cache_config(CacheConfig::default().with_session_key(format!("tenant-{id}/{session_id}")));
```

A blank key is treated as unset rather than sent literally — an empty
`prompt_cache_key` would route every caller who did that onto one cache.

This is gated on the `supports_prompt_cache_key` compat flag, which is on only
for native OpenAI. `prompt_cache_key` is OpenAI's field: a strict
OpenAI-compatible server that validates unknown keys would reject the whole
request rather than ignore it, and the providers that cache automatically were
never reading it.

### DeepSeek

DeepSeek's API manages context caching automatically. yoagent does not send
Anthropic-style `cache_control` markers for DeepSeek; instead, keep stable
prefixes stable (system prompt, tool definitions, and earlier messages) and
monitor DeepSeek's `prompt_cache_hit_tokens` / `prompt_cache_miss_tokens`
usage fields through `Usage.cache_read` and `Usage.input`.

### Google Gemini — implicit only, deliberately

yoagent sends no cache directives to Gemini and ignores `CacheStrategy` there.
Gemini caches implicitly, and the `cachedContentTokenCount` yoagent reads back
into `Usage.cache_read` reports that automatic behaviour — it is telemetry, not
an acknowledgement of anything the client asked for.

Gemini's *explicit* caching is a different kind of thing: you create a
`CachedContent` object, get a handle, reference it by name on later requests,
and manage its TTL and its own billing line. That does not fit behind
`CacheStrategy`, which describes where to put markers inside a single request.
Wiring it there would mean either misrepresenting a stateful server-side
resource as a per-request flag, or silently creating objects whose lifetime the
caller cannot see. It is worth doing as its own API, and it is not worth
pretending the current enum can express it.

## Configuration

Caching is **enabled by default** with automatic breakpoint placement. No configuration needed for optimal behavior.

### Disable Explicit Cache Hints

```rust
use yoagent::{CacheConfig, CacheStrategy};

let agent = Agent::from_config(ModelConfig::anthropic("claude-sonnet-5", "Claude Sonnet 5"))
    .with_cache_config(CacheConfig::disabled());
```

This suppresses every cache hint yoagent would send — Anthropic's
`cache_control` breakpoints and OpenAI's `prompt_cache_key` alike. It does
**not** turn off a provider's automatic server-side caching, such as DeepSeek's
or Gemini's, which is not under client control.

### Fine-Grained Control

```rust
let agent = Agent::from_config(ModelConfig::anthropic("claude-sonnet-5", "Claude Sonnet 5"))
    .with_cache_config(CacheConfig::new().with_strategy(CacheStrategy::Manual {
        cache_system: true,
        cache_tools: true,
        cache_messages: false, // Don't cache conversation history
    }));
```

`CacheConfig` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so construct it with `new()` / `disabled()`
/ `default()` plus the `with_strategy` and `with_session_key` builders rather
than a struct literal.

Setting every `Manual` flag to `false` means "cache nothing" and is treated as
equivalent to `Disabled` on every protocol — including key-routed ones, which
send no key in that case.

## Monitoring Cache Usage

Every `Usage` struct includes cache statistics:

```rust
// After a response:
let usage = message.usage(); // from assistant message
println!("Cache read: {} tokens", usage.cache_read);
println!("Cache write: {} tokens", usage.cache_write);
println!("Cache hit rate: {:.1}%", usage.cache_hit_rate() * 100.0);
```

- **`cache_read`** — tokens served from cache (cheap)
- **`cache_write`** — tokens written to cache when the provider reports that metric
- **`cache_hit_rate()`** — fraction of input tokens from cache (0.0–1.0)

## Cost Impact

For a typical 10-turn agent conversation with Anthropic Claude:

| Without Caching | With Caching (auto) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| ~500K input tokens billed at full price | ~50K at full price + ~450K at 10% price |
| **$1.50** (Claude Sonnet 5) | **$0.29** (Claude Sonnet 5) |

That's an **~80% cost reduction** with zero configuration.

## Cache-Stable Compaction

Everything above is about placing cache breakpoints correctly. That only pays off if the bytes *behind* the breakpoint stop changing — and in a long session the thing that changes them is compaction.

A cache hit requires the new request to share a **byte-identical prefix** with the previous one. So the moment compaction rewrites a message that has already been sent, every token from that point onward is uncached and billed at full price. Before 0.15, compaction decided purely on a token budget and never counted that cost.

yoagent 0.15 treats this as a first-class design constraint, in three parts.

### 1. History stops churning

Compaction is a pure function of its input, and idempotent where it can be. (On wasm32, `LlmCompaction` never summarises — there is no runtime to run the request on — so only its deterministic tiers apply.)

- **Tool-output truncation fits its own budget.** The `[... N lines truncated ...]` marker is charged against `tool_output_max_lines`, so truncating an already-truncated result returns it byte for byte. Previously the marker pushed the result *over* the limit, so the next pass re-truncated it and restated the count — a second full-prefix invalidation on top of the first.
- **Markers carry no drifting state.** The compaction marker's text is constant and generated summaries inherit the timestamp of what they replace, so the same history always compacts to the same bytes.
- **Boundaries snap to turn starts**, which also prevents orphaned `tool_use`/`tool_result` pairs that providers reject outright.

### 2. Output is bounded where it can be bounded well

One global line cap cannot serve every tool, because tools differ in how well they survive being cut:

| output shape | bound | why |
|---|---|---|
| Command output (`bash`, `search`) | `tool_output_max_lines` (200), head+tail, applied on append | first error at the top, summary at the bottom, repetition in the middle |
| File reads (`read_file`) | pages at `DEFAULT_READ_MAX_LINES` (500), exempt from truncation | the middle of a source file is the part that was asked for; paging is lossless and directed |

Applying the cap **on append** rather than retroactively is what keeps the prefix intact: the bytes the provider cached are the bytes that stay. Per-tool budgets live in `tool_output_max_lines_overrides`; `usize::MAX` exempts a tool.

### 3. The compaction target adapts

This is the part a fixed setting cannot do.

Compaction triggers at the budget but reduces to a *target* below it, so the next turn does not immediately cross the budget again and rewrite history. Expressing that target as a fixed fraction has a flaw: **a ratio has no idea how fast the session is growing**, so the headroom it leaves is arbitrary, and the interval between compactions collapses as history accumulates.

`compact_headroom_turns` targets the interval directly:

```text
target        = budget − turns × growth_per_turn
effective     = clamp( min(target / budget, compact_target_ratio), MIN_HEADROOM_RATIO, 1.0 )
```

- `budget` — `max_context_tokens − system_prompt_tokens`
- `turns` — `compact_headroom_turns`, how many more turns you want before the next compaction (default 30)
- `growth_per_turn` — mean tokens added per turn, measured by the agent loop
- `compact_target_ratio` — a **ceiling on retention**: the policy may compact harder than the ratio, never softer
- `MIN_HEADROOM_RATIO` (0.30; 0.15 before 0.22) — a floor, so runaway growth cannot ask compaction to discard everything. It was raised because compacting to 15% of the budget dropped the opening task prompt in most tool-heavy compactions; see [Compaction defaults](../evals/compaction-defaults.md)

One interpretable knob — *how often am I willing to compact* — that behaves the same at turn 50 and turn 2400, and self-adjusts to workload: an agent producing huge tool output gets compacted harder automatically. It is also self-limiting; on short sessions where compaction is already rare, the derived ratio ties the fixed one and nothing changes.

Mean turns between compactions:

| session | fixed ratio | adaptive target |
|---|---|---|
| 300 turns | 36.1 | 36.1 |
| 1200 turns | 27.8 | **34.3** |
| 2400 turns | 22.6 | **34.7** |

Set `compact_headroom_turns: None` to restore pure ratio behaviour.

#### Choosing a value

Replaying a 2400-turn session at a 1:10 cache-to-input price ratio:

| setting | mean context | cost | compactions |
|---|---|---|---|
| policy off (fixed ratio) | 67,402 | $3.33 | 110 |
| 20 | 61,740 | $3.02 | 86 |
| **30 (default)** | **59,033** | **$2.83** | **70** |
| 40 | 54,069 | $2.58 | 63 |
| 60 and above | 55,283 | $2.61 | 62 |

**The trade is proportional, so pick on memory rather than cost.** Cost per unit of retained context barely moves across the whole range — 4.94 down to 4.73, about 4%. There is no efficient point in this table for the data to single out: lowering the setting sells retained history for money at a nearly fixed exchange rate. Going from 30 to 40 costs 8.7% less and keeps 8.4% less. Choose it on how much history your agent needs to do its job; the cost follows mechanically.

The 4% that is *not* proportional is the genuinely free part, and it comes from compacting less often rather than from retaining less.

**Above roughly 60 the setting stops doing anything.** (These runs predate 0.22 and used the old 0.15 floor; with today's 0.30 floor the clamp is reached at a lower setting.) The derived ratio hits [`MIN_HEADROOM_RATIO`] and clamps, so 60, 80, 100 and 140 produce byte-identical runs. To compact harder than that, lower `compact_target_ratio` — it is the ceiling the headroom policy is capped by, not an independent knob.

**Cheaper cache argues for a smaller context, not a larger one.** The same step from a fixed ratio to headroom 60 saves 19.4% at a 1:4 cache-to-input ratio and 26.0% at 1:50. That reads backwards until you notice that once cached tokens are nearly free per token, they dominate the *count* — and you are re-sending them on every request. Vendor ratios in practice run from about 1:10 to 1:50, so the payoff for a smaller working context is larger than a 1:4 assumption would suggest.

### Measured effect

`tests/context_cache_test.rs` replays a session through compaction turn by turn, renders each turn as a provider body would see it, and measures the shared prefix between consecutive requests — the direct analogue of DeepSeek's `prompt_cache_hit_tokens / prompt_tokens`. The tool mix (bash 41%, edit/write 36%, read 19%, search 4%) and file-size distribution come from 808 archived runs of a production agent built on yoagent. Old and new are measured through the identical code path, on a 128K window.

| session | 0.14.2 hit rate | 0.15.0 hit rate | 0.14.2 rewrites | 0.15.0 rewrites |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 300 turns | 93.83% | **95.69%** | 34 | **8** |
| 1200 turns | 94.24% | **95.39%** | 169 | **35** |
| 2400 turns | 94.77% | **95.27%** | 415 | **70** |

The rewrite count is the sharper signal: 0.14.2 kept its hit rate up by compacting constantly to a small context — 415 rewrites over 2400 turns — which is precisely the churn that costs money.

Priced as input-token spend across the whole session:

| session | DeepSeek | Anthropic |
|---|---|---|
| 300 turns | $1.6511 → **$1.4985** (−9.2%) | $9.3567 → **$7.9347** (−15.2%) |
| 1200 turns | $6.9307 → **$5.7563** (−16.9%) | $38.7284 → **$30.8415** (−20.4%) |
| 2400 turns | $14.3065 → **$11.2566** (−21.3%) | $78.4390 → **$60.5804** (−22.8%) |

The gap widens with session length, which is the point: the old behaviour degraded as history accumulated, and the new behaviour does not.

### Read a hit rate against its session length, not against 100%

A hit rate is only interpretable next to the number of turns that produced it.
Every turn's *new* content has never been sent before, so it can never hit. With
`n` turns of roughly equal size, the arithmetic ceiling is about

```text
(n − 1) / (n + 1)
```

— roughly 87% at 14 turns, 90% at 19, 95% at 39, and 96% only past 49. The
93–96% figures in the replay table above come from 300–2400 turn sessions, where
the ceiling is above 99% and the measured shortfall is genuinely about rewrites.
The same code measured over a 14-turn session reads ~80%, and that is not a
regression — it is the ceiling.

The practical consequence: **do not compare hit rates across sessions of
different lengths**, and do not treat a published figure as a target for a short
session. Compare rewrite counts, or compare dollars.

### Measured live: DeepSeek vs Anthropic

`examples/llm_compaction_live.rs` (run with `--features gasp`) runs a real multi-turn session and reports
per-turn cache accounting. **"Not cached" means `input + cache_write`** — both
halves are prompt tokens the provider had to process and bill for. Counting only
`input` is the trap: Anthropic books a re-processed prefix to `cache_write` and
DeepSeek has no write category at all, so an `input`-only metric makes Anthropic
look roughly ten times cheaper than it is.

| | DeepSeek v4 Flash | Claude Sonnet 5 |
|---|---|---|
| session hit rate | **79.0–83.7%** (n=5) | **75.5–79.2%** (n=5) |
| mature-turn hit rate, median | **98.4%** | 88.8% |
| mature-turn hit rate, peak | **99.7%** | 96.0% |
| `cache_write` per session | **0** | 92,733 |
| not-cached tokens from compaction | 91.9% | 49.6% |
| session cost | **$0.031** | $0.783 |
| cost per turn | **$0.0021** | $0.0392 |
| same session with caching off | $0.066 (**−53%**) | $1.377 (**−43%**) |
| output share of the bill | 73% | 61% |
| turns | 14–15 | 19–20 |

The session hit rate is measured across five runs per provider; the per-turn
figures come from one run each, because earlier runs did not record per-turn
`cache_write` and could not be re-derived. Costs are computed from the recorded
token counts at list prices — Anthropic's from `ModelConfig::claude_sonnet_5`,
DeepSeek's at its **peak-window** rate (it charges half off-peak, so that column
over-reports an off-peak run by up to 2×).

**There is no single "steady-state" number.** Within one compaction cycle the
hit rate climbs monotonically, because each turn adds a roughly constant amount
of new content to a prefix that keeps growing: on DeepSeek the residual is
26–158 tokens a turn, so it goes 88% → 95% → 99.6% across ten turns, then resets
when compaction truncates the prefix. Quote the **peak** for what a mature prefix
achieves and the **median** for what a session with this budget actually
experiences; the median moves with how often you compact, so it is a property of
your configuration, not of the provider.

DeepSeek also quantises hits to 64-token blocks — every `cache_read` figure in
that run is an exact multiple of 64 — so a trailing partial block is always
uncached. That alone caps a single turn a fraction of a point below 100%.

**Session rates are close; the mechanisms are not.** Both providers land near
80%, even though yoagent places explicit `cache_control` breakpoints for
Anthropic and sends nothing at all to DeepSeek. What differs is where the cost
falls.

**DeepSeek pays almost nothing between compactions.** Populating the cache is
free, so the only non-cached tokens are the turn's genuinely new content.
Consequently **92% of its non-cached tokens come from the two turns where
compaction rewrote history** — for this provider, compaction is essentially the
whole cache story.

**Anthropic pays a write premium continuously.** Every turn writes ~2,000–4,600
tokens at 1.25× to extend the cached prefix, which is why its curve climbs more
slowly and tops out at 96% rather than 99.7%. Compaction accounts for only ~50%
of its non-cached tokens; the other half is that ongoing write traffic. In
dollars those writes cost **3.3× the reads they enable** ($0.232 vs $0.071) —
which sounds damning until you price the counterfactual: the same session with
caching off costs $1.377, so the writes are still a 43% saving. Buying reads with
writes is the correct trade; it just means the two providers reach a similar hit
rate with materially different bills.

**Do not read the 25× cost gap as a caching result.** The two sessions are not
matched: Sonnet ran 20 turns to DeepSeek's 15 and emitted 2.8× the output
tokens, and output is the majority of both bills (61% and 73%). The comparison
that is controlled is the *shape* — zero writes versus continuous writes, 92%
versus 50% of waste attributable to compaction. The absolute dollars are one
session each and should be treated as illustrative.

One null result worth recording: lowering `DEFAULT_TRIGGER_RATIO` from 0.6 to
0.35, on the theory that a slow summarizer needs more wall-clock headroom before
the budget is crossed, changed nothing measurable on either provider. The
condition it was meant to address — repeated deterministic fallbacks because no
summary arrived in time — did not occur in those runs, so the hypothesis is
untested rather than refuted.

### Judge changes in dollars, not hit rate

Hit rate is a fair proxy while you are removing needless rewrites. It stops being one the moment a change also moves context size — **a larger context can raise the hit rate while raising the bill**, because more of what you carry is cached but you are carrying more of it. Every tuning decision above was made on input-token spend for that reason.

### Why there is no cost-benefit gate

A natural next step is to price each compaction and skip the ones that do not pay. Compaction is worth it when

```text
R  >  (I / H) · (P_input − P_cache) / P_cache
```

where `H` is the tokens it stops resending, `I` the prefix it actually invalidates, and `R` the remaining calls. Measured across every compaction event in the replay, `I/H` runs 0.02–0.72 at typical session lengths, putting break-even at **under three remaining calls** on DeepSeek pricing. The gate can only fire in the last turns of a session, and enabling it changed total cost by less than 0.2%.

That is a consequence of the work above rather than an argument against the model: once compaction is byte-stable up to the cut point, the invalidation it has to pay for is a fraction of what it saves. The economics are documented by [bash-agent](https://lloydzhou.github.io/bash-agent/), whose measurements prompted this work.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep system prompts stable** — changing the system prompt between turns invalidates the cache
2. **Don't shuffle tools** — tool order matters for cache prefix matching. Sourced tools ([`ToolSource`](tools.md#tools-that-change-at-runtime-toolsource)) are sorted by name, so order alone never costs anything, but any change to the *set* a source returns rewrites the cached prefix at the next run start
3. **Let it work automatically** — the default `CacheStrategy::Auto` is optimal for most use cases
4. **Monitor `cache_hit_rate()`** — if it's consistently low, check if your system prompt or tools are changing unexpectedly
5. **Don't rewrite history yourself** — a custom `CompactionStrategy` or `transform_context` that edits already-sent messages costs the whole prefix from that point on. Append, or cut at a boundary and leave everything before it byte-identical.
6. **Tune `compact_headroom_turns`, not `compact_target_ratio`** — the ratio has to be re-guessed for every workload and session length; the headroom policy adapts on its own. Lower it if compaction is still too frequent, raise it to preserve more history.
7. **Judge in dollars** — see the note above; a higher hit rate does not always mean a smaller bill.
