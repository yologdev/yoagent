//! Price drift audit — do this crate's hardcoded token prices still match
//! reality?
//!
//! `ModelConfig`'s priced presets are `f64` literals compiled into the crate.
//! When a vendor reprices, they keep billing at the old numbers until someone
//! edits the source and cuts a release, and nothing detects the gap. That is
//! not hypothetical: `claude_sonnet_5` carried Sonnet **4.6's** rates —
//! $3/$15 against the published $2/$10 — from **v0.9.0 through v0.16.5**,
//! 18 tagged releases, overstating every `cost_usd` for that model by 50%.
//! It was found by someone asking, not by any mechanism.
//!
//! It is **still uncorrected on the `release/0.16.x` maintenance line**, which
//! does not carry this test — a 0.16.6 would re-ship it.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --test price_audit -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Run it before a release, at step 3 of the release checklist.
//!
//! # Why models.dev, and what it is not
//!
//! [models.dev](https://github.com/anomalyco/models.dev) is an MIT-licensed,
//! schema-validated database served as JSON. It carries `cache_read` and
//! `cache_write`, which this crate needs and which many aggregators omit —
//! cache pricing is the subject of the compaction and telemetry work.
//!
//! It is **community-maintained and therefore not authoritative.** A failure
//! here is a *drift alarm* that sends a human to the vendor's own pricing page.
//! If the two disagree, the answer is "go read Anthropic", never "copy
//! models.dev". This test deliberately does not, and should never, update the
//! constants for you.
//!
//! # How this instrument avoids going quiet
//!
//! An audit that reports "clean" because it compared nothing is worse than no
//! audit — it converts an open question into false assurance. Review of the
//! first version found six distinct ways to reach a green pass having checked
//! zero fields: a renamed provider key, a restructured envelope, a renamed
//! `models`/`cost` level, an HTTP error with a JSON body, `null`, or `{}`.
//! Each is plausible for a community database with ~190 providers.
//!
//! So the pass condition is not "no drift found". It is:
//!
//! - **every field is accounted for** — compared against a number, or recorded
//!   as absent upstream. A count short of the expected total fails.
//! - **every preset is found** unless it carries an explicit, dated
//!   [`Preset::absent_upstream`] note. A rename silently dropping a model out
//!   of coverage is the failure this catches.
//! - **absent is not zero.** A missing `cache_write` prints `—`, never `0`, so
//!   the table never claims a comparison it did not make.
//! - **unknown cost keys fail.** models.dev carries tiered pricing that flat
//!   [`CostConfig`] cannot express; ignoring the structure would certify a
//!   preset that is knowably wrong above the tier boundary.
//! - **HTTP status is checked**, and a non-JSON body reports the status,
//!   content type and first bytes rather than a bare parse error.

                      has no row in it, the one gpt-5.5 row that appears in a \
                      long-context table has `-` in every long-context cell, and \

                      on a model with identical short-context rates. models.dev \
                      also contradicts itself here — `tiers[0].tier.size` is \
